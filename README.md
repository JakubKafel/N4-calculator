# N4-calculator
Simple probabilistic calculator for Infinity the Game N4 edition

Hi!

I'm Jakub. I'm not that good doing probabilistic calculations in my head under pressure, so I want to create this small tool that would help me it.
I don't indend to use it during games to be honest, but it's more a programming excercise for me to try and accomplish a bigger project that will be fun for me.

Planned features:
- simple dice roller
- GUI
- Infinity weapons implemented by file import
- all ammo types
- Shooting / Melee differentiation
- BS skills
- BS Mods
- CC skills
- CC Mods
- Cover mechanics
- ARM / BTS testing
- graph with percentage chances
- Damage calculation
- recurrent skills choice
